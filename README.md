# Spicy-Meter
The spicy meter is a sideways html range slider that adjusts the intensity of the flame and also reveals what wings are the spiciest depending on the given value of the slider. 
There are 22 wing options to choose from, most of which will have a gluten-free note next to it.
This widget heavily relies on Js and is not mobile responsive yet.
